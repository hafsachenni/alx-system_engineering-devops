# API Advanced

---

## Overview

In this project, we dived into the advanced aspects of working with APIs. We explored how to handle pagination and the art of making recursive API calls.

## Key Learnings

1. **Pagination Handling**: We learned how to handle paginated responses from APIs, enabling us to retrieve large datasets systematically and efficiently.

2. **Recursive API Calls**: Through recursive API calls, we discovered how to navigate nested data structures and retrieve comprehensive information from APIs that impose depth limitations.

3. **How to parse JSON results from an API**: We learned how to parse JSON results obtained from APIs.

4. **How to sort a dictionary by value**: We also learnt how to sort a dictionary by its values, allowing us to organize and manipulate data effectively based on specific criteria.


Let's continue our journey of exploration, learning, and growth as we embark on new adventures in the realm of advanced API utilization.
