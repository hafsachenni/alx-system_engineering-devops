# Application server

## Overview
In this project, we're enhancing our server's infrastructure by integrating an application server. The aim is to optimize the performance and reliability of our Airbnb clone project by effectively distributing incoming requests between Nginx and the application server.

## Objective
Our goal is to seamlessly integrate an application server into our server's architecture and configure it to serve the Airbnb clone project. By leveraging Nginx as a reverse proxy, we'll ensure efficient request handling and enhance the overall user experience.

## Tasks
- **Installation**: Install and configure the application server globally on the server.
- **Integration**: Integrate the application server with Nginx to serve as a reverse proxy.
- **Configuration**: Configure Nginx to efficiently route incoming HTTP requests to the application server.
- **Testing**: Verify the setup by accessing the Airbnb clone project through the web browser.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of the application server and Nginx for optimal operation.
